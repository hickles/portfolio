      <h2>Coffee and A/B testing enthusiast</h2>
      <p> My interest in agile developed into the formation of a product growth capability on our lead generation team where I PMâ€™d the refinement of an A/B analysis tool built in power BI. These insights resulted in the correction of p-values, power analysis and audience sampling to improve the accuracy of our results. </p>
